# Neural_network
## The purpose of this analysis is to implemnent Neural Networks and Deep Learning models to create a predictive binary classifier. AlphabetSoup needs a data-driven solution to decide what organizations to donate to and which ones they shouldn't. 

# Data Preprocessing
## What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
### Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL Column
## What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Dropped Variables: 'EIN' and 'NAME' Columns
# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
## How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
### First layer: 80 neurons
### Second layer: 30 neurons
## Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
### Almost, Target Score: 75%; Accuracy Score: 73%
## What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
### change the neuron layers to 60 neurons and 30 neurons, respectively, and it did not change the accuracy.
